# dcgan---demo-with-synthetic-db
My implementation of DCGAN (tensorflow based) trained on a synthetic database large as you want

First run "create_bench_folders.py" (change bench_name to any name you want)
Then run "main.py" with similar bench_name

See in Samples folder the evolving of the rectangles structure

The model consists of an inverse G network, which still failed to be trained well enough.
Hopfuly in next versions
